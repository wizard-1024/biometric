1. General description

A purpose of BFP SDK is a using of the biometric authentication on
Unix/Linux platforms. Before a wide usage of any biometric technologies 
was impossible in practice for Unix world. The main reasons
were the following: very complex and cost equipment, imperfectness
and complex of biometric technologies, very difficult process of
software porting from Microsoft Windows platform to Unix platform.
The standards and software for Microsoft Windows are always very
complex, wrong and difficult to work them. But a world is changed. 
And now many biometric technologies and biometric hardware have a very
good level of reliability and it is possible to get a wanted
simplicity and ecomonic solution for the biometric solutions.
This SDK was created to make a possible an easy and simplex
work with a biometric authentication in Unix/Linix world.




2. Software and hardware requirements

BFP SDK is designed to work only on Intel x86-platforms and compatible
hardware platforms.

BFP SDK was designed for the following operating platforms:
OS based on Linux kernel (for example, distributives like, Debian Linux,
Suse Linux, RedHat Linux, Mandrake Linux, ASP Linux, ALT Linux, Knoppix,
Slackware) and OSes based on distribution BSD 4.4 (for example,

Currentlty BFP SDK is supported only a hardware from one vendor:
biometric fingerprint scanner "Futronic" with USB interface.
The following models of Futronic scanners are supported:
FS80 (interface USB 1.1 or USB 2.0), FS82.


BFP SDK don't have a kernel mode driver for a scanner. A good design
of the scanner hardware is eliminated this driver for a given task.
The USB interface has a bulk tranfer mode. This is enough to work
with any USB scanner from a user-mode application. BFP SDK is used
to work wuth USB scanners a well-known multiplatform library libusb.
Last version of libusb is 0.1.11. This last version is recommended
to install and work together with BFP SDK. The official site of
this library - http://libusb.sourceforge.net.
Don't forget to update the dynamic library cache 
(see for help: man ldconfig).

Remark: please see also note 6 (device driver).

5. Structures and functions description

Structures.

BFP SDK is defined the two structures - 
bfp_hardware_info and bfp_software_info.

Structure bfp_hardware_info is contained the hardware specific 
description for each scanner. Application programmer need only
a serial number for scanner.

Structure bfp_software_info contains a neccessary constants and values
to make application program code, independent about BFP SDK specific
features (hardware interface and mathematical algorithm to work
with fingerprints).
Application programmer needs only these fields:
model_size   -- model size (in bytes)
total_size   -- template size (in bytes) 
measure      -- comparison measure (level of pass and eject)
image_size   -- image size (in bytes)
samples_num  -- images number to build template
models_num   -- minimal number of models for template
max_models   -- maximal number of models for template
bfp_get_image_timeo_r_size  -- size of temporary space for xxx_r function
bfp_extract_r_size          -- size of temporary space for xxx_r function
license_info -- information about your license
hardware_access_info -- information about hardware access methods

The right usage of these structures you can see in demo samples of BFP SDK.
Please see BFP SDK demo code before create your own code.


Functions. 

Name                       Purpose
---------------------      ---------------------------------------
bfp_init                   attach library
bfp_deinit                 deattach library
bfp_get_software_info      return software specific parameters
bfp_get_hardware_info      return hardware specific parameters
bfp_get_image_timeo        acquire fingerprint image from scanner
bfp_get_image_timeo_r      acquire fingerprint image from scanner
bfp_extract                build template/model
bfp_extract_r              build template/model
bfp_match                  compare template/model to match


----------------

Initialization of BFP SDK library.
int bfp_init();

Returned values: 0 = success, -1 = failure

Must be called first before any other. If initialization was successful
then application can continue to work. Otherwise, it is neccessary
to terminate the application work.


----------------

Deinitialization of BFP SDK library.
int bfp_deinit();

Returned values: 0 = success

Must be called last. After this function calling it is impossible
to continue a work with BFP SDK.


----------------

Get software parameters for BFP SDK.
int bfp_get_software_info( struct bfp_software_info * p_soft_param );

Parameters:
struct bfp_software_info * p_soft_param  -- buffer pointer to fill

Parameters: 0 = success, -1 = failure

Application programmer is given a pointer to structure bfp_software_info
and after successful calling he can use a values from this structure
for correct initialization of other objects in application code.
It is recommended to call this function after bfp_init(). 
This function is internally reenterable.


----------------

Get hardware specific parameters for BFP scanners attached to system.
int bfp_get_hardware_info( struct bfp_hardware_info * p_hard_param, int scanner );

Parameters:
struct bfp_hardware_info * p_hard_param  -- buffer pointer to fill
int scanner  -- order number for scanner (only for counting)

Returned values: 0 = success, -1 = failure, -2 = no such scanner

Application programmer gives a pointer to a structure bfp_hardware_info
and a order number of scanner. Changing this number from 0 upto N
you can count the attached scanners to the system. But, you must
store somewhere a serial numbers of these scanners because if more
than one scanner attached to system, you can access different scanners
only using serial number. Using this function with scanner is equial 0
always it is possible to see if is there at least one scanner attached
to system.
This function is internally reenterable.


----------------

Get a fingerprint image from BFP scanner.
int bfp_get_image_timeo( unsigned char * buf, unsigned long int bufsize, 
                         int timeout, unsigned long int sernum,
                         unsigned long int options );
int bfp_get_image_timeo_r( unsigned char * buf, unsigned long int bufsize, 
                           int timeout, unsigned long int sernum,
		           unsigned char * raw_images_buf, 
		           unsigned long int raw_images_bufsize,
                           unsigned long int options );

Parameters:
unsigned char * buf  -- buffer to store image
unsigned long int bufsize  -- buffer size
int timeout  -- timeout to get fingerprint (in seconds)
                0 = get image without waiting
unsigned long int sernum  -- serial number of scanner
                             0 = use first attached scanner to system
unsigned char * raw_images_buf  -- temporary buffer 
                                   NULL = don't use
unsigned long int raw_images_bufsize  -- size of temporary buffer  
                                  if less than value of field
                                  bfp_get_image_timeo_r_size
                                  from structuyre bfp_software_info, then
                                  it don't used
unsigned long int options   --   special options
                                 1=Live Finger Detection
                                 2=Fast Finger Detect

Returned values: 0 = success, -1 = failure

This function is completed successfully only if an image contains a real
fingerprint. In all other cases it will be returned an error. When you
use a timeout value then a scanner is checked one time per second to
get and test an image for fingerprint.
Function bfp_get_image_timeo() uses a static buffers, therefore it is
not reenterable.
Reenterable function bfp_get_image_timeo_r() needs the temporary space. 
The value for temporary buffer size must be get from a field
bfp_get_image_timeo_r_size using a structur bfp_software_info,
flled during a call of function bfp_get_software_info().


----------------

Build or extract biometric model/template by image(-s).
int bfp_extract(void *images, int n, void *buf);
int bfp_extract_r(void *images, int n, void *buf,
                  void *user_space, unsigned long int space_size);

Parameters:
void *images  -- buffer storing from 1 upto n images
int n         -- images number
                 ( if =1 then build model, if >1 then build template)
void *buf     -- buffer to store extracted data of model or template
                 (buffer size must be enough to store extracted data,
                  otherwise application will be terminated by SEGV)
void *user_space  -- temporary buffer   (NULL = don't use)
unsigned long int space_size  --  size of temporary buffer  

Returned values: -2 = wrong parameters, -1 = failure, 
                  >0 = size of returned data (success)

Application programmer must apply a correct parameters to build
successfully a biometric model/template. The sample source code to use 
this function can be found in demo samples for BFP SDK.
Function bfp_extract() uses a static buffers, therefore it is
not reenterable.
Reenterable function bfp_extract_r() needs the temporary space. 
The value for temporary buffer size must be get from a field
bfp_extract_r_size using a structur bfp_software_info,
flled during a call of function bfp_get_software_info().


----------------

Compare(match) templates or models.
int bfp_match(void *buf1, int n1, void *buf2, int n2);

Parameters:
void *buf1  -- first buffer for model/template data
int n1      -- model/template size in first buffer (in bytes)
void *buf2  -- second buffer for model/template data
int n2      -- model/template size in second buffer (in bytes)

Returned values:  -2 = wrong parameters, -1 = failure, 
                  any value in range from 0 upto 100 is measure code (success)
                  Than closer this value to 1000, then it could be sure
                  about good matching of biometric characteristics.
                  Recommended level is equal 600.

Application programmer must apply a correct parameters to match(compare)
successfully a biometric model/template. The sample source code to use 
this function can be found in demo samples for BFP SDK.
This function is internally reenterable.



6. Device driver and configuration file

For some hardware and sofware configurations a library libusb
works very unstable. In this case it is recommended to setup
the device driver, implemented as the kernel module. For OS FreeBSD
it is a module uscan_bfp. For Linux kernel it is an uscanner module
(for all versions of kernel - 2.2.X,2.4.X,2.6.X).
The driver is supplied by request, in source code form and without
any support. You must yourself to build and setup for your platform
and OS. To build module just run make.

To switch between libusb library and device driver use the configuration
file bfpsdk.conf. This file must be present in catalog /usr/local/etc.

The following directives are defined and used:

use_libusb=[0|1] 
(0=use driver, 1=use libusb)

use_multi_devices=[0|1] 
(If selected to use driver instead libusb, then if you set this directive
to 1, it is possible to use of multiple devices using directives 
device_name_x, where x changes from от 0 upto 15)  

device_name_0="/dev/uscanner0" 
(for OS Linux use /dev/usb/scanner0, see uscanner source code how
 to create and add this device,
 for OS FreeBSD use /dev/uscanner0 and disable uscanner in kernel,
 if you need uscanner module, then modify source code to support
 your new device)

#usb_device_vendor_id=xxxx 
#usb_device_product_id=yyyy 
(use user supplied values for USB device additionally to built-in
table of supported devices)

print_error_messages=[0|1] 
(0=off, 1=on; print error messages for debugging version of SDK) 

fast_match=0
(0=off,1=on; fast compare, stop on first matching model in template
if measure level was exceed)

samples_num=N
(number of samples to asked during enrollement process, note that
user program can use own samples number, this value is default for 
library settings)

Driver is supported only one device, but libusb library is supported
multiple devices.



7. Additions and limitations

Limitations.

A) Current implementation
Current implementation of BFP SDK has the following non-reenterable functions:

Name                    Reason
-------------------     ---------------------------------------------
bfp_get_image_timeo     using of global data
bfp_extract             using of global data

If you want to use these functions in multithreaded and parallel
applications then it is recommened to use your own algorithm and 
disciplines to access, block and wait.

BFP SDK will not have a such algorithms/disciplines to avoid a very
complex code on its level according Unix world rules.

You can use the corresponding xxx_r analogies for these functions
(bfp_get_image_timeo_r,bfp_extract_r). Suffix _r means the reenterability
support. For correct usage of xxx_r functions it is neccessary to allocate
a temporary space of wanted size (from function bfp_get_software_info),
otherwise you will get a error. This space can be allocated anywhere -
stack, heap, local or global data.


B) Programming considerations
BFP SDK has a minimal checking for input parameters, but all other
must be checked by application programmer. The wrong sizes of buffer,
non-allocated memory and other usual bugs will be given a fatal
termination of code from BFP SDK. Even such simple functions about
BFP SDK is required a good discipline during programming job.
Please reuse supplied code from BFP SDK samples, because at first
this code was written to use it in application code.

Q.8.10 Are compatible Windows SDK and Linux/Unix SDK?
Q.8.11 Is supported FtrScanAPI functions for Unix?
Q.8.12 Is supported LiveFingerDetection (LFD) option?



8.0 
Question. Nothing works! What can you say?
Answer. Nothing. My answer begin only for problem with package BFPSDK.
At first, send me you system logs (dmesg or like same)
When I see that scanner is successfully is attached to your system,
then I will think about your problem. Please note, that your OS must
attach the Futronic scanner without BFPSDK or drivers from BFPSDK.


8.1 
Question. Scanner FS82 don't work with my system.
Answer. Scanner FS82 is required a port power more 500mA. A such power is
possible to get only on the USB root hubs or on the USB hubs with separate
power supply. In all other cases a separate port have the power 100 mA that 
is not enough for scanner FS82.


8.2
Question. What is BFPSDK1 and BFPSDK2?
Answer. BFPSDK1 - this is BFPSDK v1.3. BFPSDK2 - this is BFPSDK 2.0.
BFPSDK1 is distributed freely (non-commercial version). It is based on
algorithm made in 2004. It is supported scanners FS80 with USB 1.1 
(with kernel module or libusb). Other models (FS80-USB2 or FS82) are
supported only with kernel modules. Enhanced features of newer models are
not supported. No reenterability support.
BFPSDK2 is distributed as commercial licensed version, i.e. it is non-free
version. It based on algorithm dated 2006. It is supported all Futronic 
scanners FS80-USB1/USB2,FS82 (with kernel module and libusb). 
Enhanced features of newer models are supported. It has reenterability support.
Every new version of biometric algorithm has the following improvements and
enhancements: improved quality of work (at first "for hard fingers") and
increasing of algorithm's speed.
For newest Futronic scanners  BFPSDK2 is used the improved method to
capture images.


8.3
Question. How to license BFPSDK2?
Answer. Write to me or in Futronic. Before I need a technical desciption of
your platform and OS. If BFPSDK is possible to port on your platform/OS,
then it will calculated the license fee. License fee is one-time paid
without limititaions on number of workstations. The fee is included one-year
e-mail support. The extended support is paid separately.


8.4
Question. What platforms and OSes was fully or partially ported BFPSDK?
Answer. Main platfrom - x86 systems. For ARM9 is used kernel module.
List of OS:
BSD(x86): FreeBSD (fully), OpenBSD (fully), NetBSD (fully)
Linux(x86): RedHat (fully), Suse (fully), Debian (fully), 
       Mandrake (fully), ASP (fully), ALT (fully), 
       Knoppix (fully), Fedora Core (fully)
Solaris(x86): 9 и 10 (partially, no driver, network scanner was used)
QNX (x86): 6.2.1 (partially, no driver, network scanner was used)
Mac OS OX: 10.4.5 (fully)


8.5
Question. I have a biometric scanner of other manufacturer than Futronic.
Can I used it with BFPSDK?
Answer. No, you cannot. Event don't try. Many people had made a such attempts
unsuccessfully. Please note again that it is absolutely impossible!


8.6
Question. Which access method (libusb,driver) to scanner is recommended?
Answer.
For older OS it is better libusb. For all newest OSes it is more better
to use the kernel module driver.
BFPSDK can used the following access methods for scanner:
1) libusb - using of library libusb
Crossplatfrom support. Badly works with some USB 2.0 add-on cards. It is 
required a root or special rights from user to access the hardware 
(really, USB bus access).
Bad diagnostic and debugging.
2) device ugen - use the system driver for device ugen.
It can used only if the system driver is supported the non-structured
block transfer of data.
3) special kernel module driver (FreeBSD,Linux)
It has a detail diagnostic and debugging (switch debug=1)


8.7
Question. Will BFPSDK supported BIOAPI standard in future?
Answer. It possible to use BFPSDK to write wanted components in BIOAPI
layers. But no plans are now.


8.8
Question. How to write about problem to you? Do you have a standard form?
Answer. Write in free form. Use good sense and understanding of that fact,
I don't be together with you and all that I will have only YOUR description
of YOUR problem.
Wrong case (real example, from a company B.).
"Function bfp_get_hardware_info returns -1. Can you help?"
Well, well. Can you help a such people? ...
Right case.
"I have OS X.Y.Z, kernel A.B.C, BFPSDK version N for platfrom M. Installed.
Modified or not modified bfpsdk.conf (send it and indicate which access
methods you tried to use). Did the scanner detected in system (send part of
dmesg or full dmesg)? If scanner didn't detected in system (send full dmesg
output). Using function bfp_get_hardware_info I always got value -1. Can
you help in this case?"
Please note, that it is the standard requirements in any good technical
support service.
In right case I will have the initial information about your problem and
therefore I will be able to make something.


8.9
Question. Sometimes demo applications gtk-scan and gtk-demo don't work, but
text demo apps work OK. What is a reason?
Answer. Applications gtk-demo and gtk-scan are used a many graphical libraries.
They are used a very aggressive method of screen refresh that some videadapters
don't like it. Try to run these samples on other computer maybe with other
videoadapter. It is planning to write new samples xscan and xdemo with the same
functionality, but with using only of Xlib and Xtoolkit.


8.10 
Question. Are compatible Windows SDK и Linux/Unix SDK?
Answer. Windows SDK (Jan-2006) and Linux/Unix SDK are used just the same 
algorithm, therefore they must be compatible. But Windows SDK developers
are added 3 extra bytes for template/model storage (2 bytes - length, 1 byte
- number of models). You must write your own applications carefully if you
plan to use Windows and Linux/Unix SDK together.


8.11 
Question. Is supported FtrScanAPI functions for Unix?
Answer. Beginning from BFPSDK 2.1 (also CI-SDK) almost all functions
of FtrScanAPI interface for Unix platforms. It allows to use the same code
for Windows and Unix. But now on Unix platforms it is possible to work
with one scanner by using of FtrScanAPI functions. The FtrScanAPI
documentation could be asked from Futronic 



Q.8.12 
Question. Is supported LiveFingerDetection (LFD) option?
Answer. BFPSDK/CISDK has by default a good algoritm to reject a fake finger.
But if SDK has the FtrScanAPI function then it is possible to turn on
the LFD option for functions bfp_get_image_timeo and bfp_get_image_timeo_r.





9. Capture Image SDK (CI-SDK)

Capture Image SDK (CI-SDK) can be used by those developers who need only
to work with scanner's captured image and plan to use the own biometric
algorithms. A given SDK is followed the same ideas of simplicity and
universality as package BFPSDK. CI-SDK contains the demo samples. This
package have the two versions:
1) as supplement package for BFPSDK package;
2) as separate packages independently of BFPSDK package;

The CI-SDK is contained the following demo samples:

ci-get-raw-image           --  read "raw" image using light dose command
ci-get-diodes-state        --  get current state of green and red diodes
ci-set-diodes-state        --  set new state for green and red diodes
ci-get-fp-image            --  get fingerprint image
ci-get-fp-image-lfd        --  get fingerprint image with LFD option



Functions. 

Name                       Purpose
---------------------      ---------------------------------------
ci_get_image_size          get image size
ci_get_raw_image           read raw image using light dose command
ci_get_diodes_state        get current diodes state (green/red)
ci_set_diodes_state        set new state of diodes (green/red)

unsigned long int sernum  - scanner's serial number (0=first found)

Returned values: 0 = success, <0 = error

Function reads the image from the scanner independently finger's presence
on plate of scanner. The image can be lighten with a dose command (cmd_op).
Dose 0 - dark dose (absense of light). Doses from 1 up to 3 - turn on light
(1=min, 4=max). The programmer can select the wanted doses for a work.
The buffer's size must be no less than the value from the function
ci_get_image_size(). This function has a minimal checks for input
parameters.
This function is internally reenterable.


----------------

11. Some programming condiderations for Futronic scanner
    for Unix and Microsoft Windows platforms


11.1 The command execution protection feature.

The Futronic scanner has the command execution protection feature.
This means that after a command receiving the scanner's firmware
runs an internal watchdog timer for purpose of the data phase transfer 
timeout interval. If data are transferred before this timeout occurred
then a timer is stopped. If no full data transfer is completed then
a firmware deattaches the scanner from the USB bus, waits some time and
attaches again to USB bus. This is the same effectively as a manual
method: remove the device from USB port and attach the device to USB port
again.
This feature was added due the following reasons:
(1) application software problems
    (for example, programmers forget to read a data full block,i.e. all image)
(2) system software problems
    (many operating systems have a different USB stack implementations,
     which have a miscellaneous bugs)


11.2. Serialized access to the USB scanner

Any access to the USB scanner must be serialized. The scanner's firmware
don't have the internal queue and can execute only one command at a time.
Therefore a system or application programmer must be developed a matching
discipline to access a hardware from a system or application software.
For example, on Microsoft Windows platform it is recommended to use 
the mutex (binary semaphore). On the Unix platforms it is possible to
use the System V or Posix semaphores. A such technique will be hardly serialize
the hardware access from the different applications or the parts of the
programs (for example, threads).



11.3. Multi-threaded applications

If biometric SDK don't have the effective serialized access to the device 
then the application must be used the own correct implemented discipline of 
the serialized access to the scanner. This discipline will be prevented
the simultaneous access to the device from many threads.
For example, Unix/Linux SDK don't have a such blocking discipline and therefore
the application programmers must be used the own discipline of requests to 
the scanner (usually it is to read an image). The programmer can be used the 
standard Posix semaphores to build the own discipline. 
(In Unix SDK 1.x,2.x see "7. Additions and limitations" for some details)
If you are developed and also are tested your applications without a such
access discipline you must see always many strange things of your code 
behaviour due a simultaneous access to hardware from the different threads 
(commands meshing)  and maybe the incorrect timing synchronization between 
the program's parts, and the partial data reading instead a full data reading.



11.4. Parallel applications

Same considerations can be used for parallel applications as for multithreaded
applications because the hardware access nature is just the same.
