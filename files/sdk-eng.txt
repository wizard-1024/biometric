1. General description

A purpose of BFP SDK is a using of the biometric authentication on
Unix/Linux platforms. Before a wide usage of any biometric technologies 
was impossible in practice for Unix world. The main reasons
were the following: very complex and cost equipment, imperfectness
and complex of biometric technologies, very difficult process of
software porting from Microsoft Windows platform to Unix platform.
The standards and software for Microsoft Windows are always very
complex, wrong and difficult to work them. But a world is changed. 
And now many biometric technologies and biometric hardware have a very
good level of reliability and it is possible to get a wanted
simplicity and ecomonic solution for the biometric solutions.
This SDK was created to make a possible an easy and simplex
work with a biometric authentication in Unix/Linix world.




2. Software and hardware requirements

BFP SDK is designed to work only on Intel x86-platforms and compatible
hardware platforms.

BFP SDK was designed for the following operating platforms:
OS based on Linux kernel (for example, distributives like, Debian Linux,
Suse Linux, RedHat Linux, Mandrake Linux, ASP Linux) and OSes based on 
kernel BSD 4.4 (for example, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD).
It is supported all versions of Linux kernel, beginning from 2.2.18
and all versions of OS FreeBSD, started from 4.9 version.
It is also supported all versions of OS OpenBSD, started from 3.0 version,
and all versions of OS NetBSD, started from 1.5.2 version.
At moment of writing of this manual the current versions were the following:
Linix kernel - 2.4.30 and 2.6.11;
OS FreeBSD - 4.11 or 5.3;
NetBSD - 2.0;
OpenBSD - 3.6;

BFP SDK was tested for the following hardware platforms and OSes:
1) Intel Pentium 200Mhz, 64MB memory, Intel chipset 430HX
   (Mainboard P/I-XP55T2P4)  
   FreeBSD 4.11, 
   OpenBSD 3.0, 
   Suse Linux 6.3 (kernel 2.2.25),
   RedHat Linux 6.2 (kernel 2.2.18,2.2.25,2.4.25);
2) Intel Pentium 166MHz, 64MB memory, Intel chipset 430TX 
   (Mainboard Asus TX97-XE) -
   FreeBSD 4.11, 
   NetBSD 1.5.2;
   Debian Linux (kernel 2.4.14)
3) Intel Pentium III 2x1000Mhz, 1 GB memory, VIA Apollo Pro133A chipset
   (Mainboard 694D Pro2-IR, MS-6321 v2.X)
   FreeBSD 4.11, 
   Suse Linux 7.3 (kernel 2.4.10 - 2.4.20),
   RedHat Linux 9.0 (kernel 2.4.20 - 2.6.5),
   Mandrake Linux 8.1 (kernel 2.4.8),
   Mandrake Linux 9.1 (kernel 2.4.21);
   Mandrake Linux 10.0 (kernel 2.6.11);   
4) Intel Pentium III 1GHz, 512 MB memory, VIA Twister
   (Asus B1000 Series)
   FreeBSD 5.3
   RedHat Linux 9.0 (kernel 2.4.20 - 2.6.1)
   
Currentlty BFP SDK is supported only a hardware from one vendor:
biometric fingerprint scanner "Futronic" with USB interface.
Is is not planned to support the scanners of other vendors
at least in near future.

BFP SDK don't have a kernel mode driver for a scanner. A good design
of the scanner hardware is eliminated this driver for a given task.
The USB interface has a bulk tranfer mode. This is enough to work
with any USB scanner from a user-mode application. BFP SDK is used
to work wuth USB scanners a well-known multiplatform library libusb.
Last version of libusb is 0.1.7. This last version is recommended
to install and work together with BFP SDK. The official site of
this library - http://libusb.sourceforge.net.
Don't forget to update the dynamic library cache 
(see for help: man ldconfig).

Remark: please see also note 6 (device driver).

5. Structures and functions description

Structures.

BFP SDK is defined the two structures - 
bfp_hardware_info and bfp_software_info.

Structure bfp_hardware_info is contained the hardware specific 
description for each scanner. Application programmer need only
a serial number for scanner.

Structure bfp_software_info contains a neccessary constants and values
to make application program code, independent about BFP SDK specific
features (hardware interface and mathematical algorithm to work
with fingerprints).
Application programmer needs only these fields:
model_size   -- model size (in bytes)
total_size   -- template size (in bytes) 
measure      -- comparison measure (level of pass and eject)
image_size   -- image size (in bytes)
samples_num  -- images number to build template
models_num   -- minimal number of models for template
max_models   -- maximal number of models for template

The right usage of these structures you can see in demo samples of BFP SDK.
Please see BFP SDK demo code before create your own code.


Functions. 

Name                       Purpose
---------------------      ---------------------------------------
bfp_init                   attach library
bfp_deinit                 deattach library
bfp_get_software_info      return software specific parameters
bfp_get_hardware_info      return hardware specific parameters
bfp_get_image_timeo        acquire fingerprint image from scanner
bfp_extract                build template/model
bfp_match                  compare template/model to match


----------------

Initialization of BFP SDK library.
int bfp_init();

Returned values: 0 = success, -1 = failure

Must be called first before any other. If initialization was successful
then application can continue to work. Otherwise, it is neccessary
to terminate the application work.

----------------

Deinitialization of BFP SDK library.
int bfp_deinit();

Returned values: 0 = success

Must be called last. After this function calling it is impossible
to continue a work with BFP SDK.

----------------

Get software parameters for BFP SDK.
int bfp_get_software_info( struct bfp_software_info * p_soft_param );

Parameters:
struct bfp_software_info * p_soft_param  -- buffer pointer to fill

Parameters: 0 = success, -1 = failure

Application programmer is given a pointer to structure bfp_software_info
and after successful calling he can use a values from this structure
for correct initialization of other objects in application code.
It is recommended to call this function after bfp_init(). 

----------------

Get hardware specific parameters for BFP scanners attached to system.
int bfp_get_hardware_info( struct bfp_hardware_info * p_hard_param, int scanner );

Parameters:
struct bfp_hardware_info * p_hard_param  -- buffer pointer to fill
int scanner  -- order number for scanner (only for counting)

Returned values: 0 = success, -1 = failure, -2 = no such scanner

Application programmer gives a pointer to a structure bfp_hardware_info
and a order number of scanner. Changing this number from 0 upto N
you can count the attached scanners to the system. But, you must
store somewhere a serial numbers of these scanners because if more
than one scanner attached to system, you can access different scanners
only using serial number. Using this function with scanner is equial 0
always it is possible to see if is there at least one scanner attached
to system.

----------------

Get a fingerprint image from BFP scanner.
int bfp_get_image_timeo( unsigned char * buf, unsigned long int bufsize, 
                         int timeout, unsigned long int sernum );

Parameters:
unsigned char * buf  -- buffer to store image
unsigned long int bufsize  -- buffer size
int timeout  -- timeout to get fingerprint (in seconds)
                0 = get image without waiting
unsigned long int sernum  -- serial number of scanner
                             0 = use first attached scanner to system

Returned values: 0 = success, -1 = failure

This function is completed successfully only if an image contains a real
fingerprint. In all other cases it will be returned an error. When you
use a timeout value then a scanner is checked one time per second to
get and test an image for fingerprint.


----------------

Build or extract biometric model/template by image(-s).
int bfp_extract(void *images, int n, void *buf);

Parameters:
void *images  -- buffer storing from 1 upto n images
int n         -- images number
                 ( if =1 then build model, if >1 then build template)
void *buf     -- buffer to store extracted data of model or template
                 (buffer size must be enough to store extracted data,
                  otherwise application will be terminated by SEGV)

Returned values: -2 = wrong parameters, -1 = failure, 
                  >0 = size of returned data (success)

Application programmer must apply a correct parameters to build
successfully a biometric model/template. The sample source code to use 
this function can be found in demo samples for BFP SDK.


----------------

Compare(match) templates or models.
int bfp_match(void *buf1, int n1, void *buf2, int n2);

Parameters:
void *buf1  -- first buffer for model/template data
int n1      -- model/template size in first buffer (in bytes)
void *buf2  -- second buffer for model/template data
int n2      -- model/template size in second buffer (in bytes)

Returned values:  -2 = wrong parameters, -1 = failure, 
                  any value in range from 0 upto 100 is measure code (success)
                  Than closer this value to 1000, then it could be sure
                  about good matching of biometric characteristics.
                  Recommended level is equal 600.

Application programmer must apply a correct parameters to match(compare)
successfully a biometric model/template. The sample source code to use 
this function can be found in demo samples for BFP SDK.



6. Device driver and configuration file

For some hardware and sofware configurations a library libusb
works very unstable. In this case it is recommended to setup
the device driver, implemented as the kernel module. For OS FreeBSD
it is a module uscan_bfp. For Linux kernel it is an uscanner module
(for all versions of kernel - 2.2.X,2.4.X,2.6.X).
The driver is supplied by request, in source code form and without
any support. You must yourself to build and setup for your platform
and OS. To build module just run make.

To switch between libusb library and device driver use the configuration
file bfpsdk.conf. This file must be present in catalog /usr/local/etc.

The following directives are defined and used:

use_libusb=[0|1] 
(0=use driver, 1=use libusb)

use_multi_devices=[0|1] 
(If selected to use driver instead libusb, then if you set this directive
to 1, it is possible to use of multiple devices using directives 
device_name_x, where x changes from от 0 upto 15)  

device_name_0="/dev/uscanner0" 
(for OS Linux use /dev/usb/scanner0, see uscanner source code how
 to create and add this device,
 for OS FreeBSD use /dev/uscanner0 and disable uscanner in kernel,
 if you need uscanner module, then modify source code to support
 your new device)

#usb_device_vendor_id=xxxx 
#usb_device_product_id=yyyy 
(use user supplied values for USB device additionally to built-in
table of supported devices)

print_error_messages=[0|1] 
(0=off, 1=on; print error messages for debugging version of SDK) 

fast_match=0
(0=off,1=on; fast compare, stop on first matching model in template
if measure level was exceed)

samples_num=N
(number of samples to asked during enrollement process, note that
user program can use own samples number, this value is default for 
library settings)

Driver is supported only one device, but libusb library is supported
multiple devices.



7. Additions and limitations

Limitations.

A) Current implementation
Current implementation of BFP SDK has the following non-reenterable functions:

Name                    Reason
-------------------     ---------------------------------------------
bfp_get_image_timeo     USB bus is not multi-channel pipe
bfp_extract             using of global data
bfp_match               using of global data

Maybe, in the next implementations it will be possible to overcome 
the limitations of two last functions: bfp_extract and bfp_match.
But first function has a natural limitation and this will not change
in future.

If you want to use these functions in multithreaded and parallel
applications then it is recommened to use your own algorithm and 
disciplines to access, block and wait.

BFP SDK will not have a such algorithms/disciplines to avoid a very
complex code on its level according Unix world rules.


B) Programming considerations
BFP SDK has a minimal checking for input parameters, but all other
must be checked by application programmer. The wrong sizes of buffer,
non-allocated memory and other usual bugs will be given a fatal
termination of code from BFP SDK. Even such simple functions about
BFP SDK is required a good discipline during programming job.
Please reuse supplied code from BFP SDK samples, because at first
this code was written to use it in application code.



C) Scanners "Futronic"
Today most scanners "Futronic" are contained a firmware without a support 
of the  serial number for scanner. BFP SDK is detected a such firmware
and will supported only one scanner per system - a first found scanner
during the USB bus scanning.

Note.
Now all scanners "Futronic" have a firmware with a serial number support.
